At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do.
First, a programmer writes codeâ€”a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. 
Next, a compiler converts each line of code into a language a computer can understand. 
Then, the computer scans the code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. 
Tasks might include displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text.
